# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Define the package as scipy.linalg import lu.

2.Get input from user and print L and U matrix by 'print' .

3.Define a package as "from scipy.linalg import lu_factor, lu_solve" and create the variable as 'X' include the package in that variable

4.print the variable 'X'

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix

/*

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
